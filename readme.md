# The Dataset

The dataset has two parts.

- The public part of Muharaf has 1,216 images and can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/11492215). We distribute this dataset under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
- The restricted part of Muharaf has 428 images distributed under a proprietary license. It can be downloaded by writing to [Carlos Younes](mailto:carlosyounes@usek.edu.lb) at Phoenix Center for Lebanese Studies, USEK. This part of the dataset is distributed under a proprietary license with the condition that it will not be re-distributed and only used for research purposes.

# ScribeArabic Annotation Software

[ScribeArabic](https://github.com/MehreenMehreen/ScribeArabic) is the annotation software used to create the Muharaf Dataset. Read its [manual](https://github.com/MehreenMehreen/ScribeArabic/blob/main/manual.md) to get an idea of how it works.

# JSON to PAGE-XML Converter

The ScribeArabic software natively uses JSON files. You can conver them to PAGE-XML using the [source code provdided in the page-xml folder](https://github.com/MehreenMehreen/xml_converter).

# Page Elements Viewer

All image files accompanied by their corresponding \_annotate files containing annotations, transcriptions and tagging can be viewed using the [XML viewer](https://github.com/MehreenMehreen/xml_converter) in the page-xml converter repository.

# Start, Follow, Read &mdash; Arabic

The HTR results reported in the paper can be reproduced using the [Start, Follow, Read &mdash; Arabic code](https://github.com/MehreenMehreen/start_follow_read_arabic) System. This code is adapted from [Start, Follow, Read System](https://github.com/cwig/start_follow_read) and its [Python3 version](https://github.com/sharmaannapurna/start_follow_read_py3).
